Number Guessing Game
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! This is a simple and interactive console-based game implemented in Java where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.

Project Overview
In this game, the computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess what the number is. The user is given up to 10 attempts to guess the number correctly. After each guess, the game provides feedback on whether the user's guess was too high, too low, or correct. Once the user either guesses the number correctly or exhausts all attempts, the game informs them of the outcome. Users can choose to play multiple rounds, and their score is tracked based on the number of rounds won.

Features
Random Number Generation: Generates a random number between 1 and 100 for each game round.
User Interaction: Prompts the user to input their guess and provides feedback on whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct.
Attempt Limitation: Limits the number of guesses to 10 per round.
Multiple Rounds: Allows the user to play multiple rounds of the game.
Score Tracking: Displays the number of rounds won at the end of the game session.
How to Play
Run the Program: Compile and execute the Java program to start the game.
Guess the Number: Enter a number between 1 and 100 when prompted.
Receive Feedback: The game will inform you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
Play Again: After each round, you can choose to play again or exit the game.
End of Game: At the end of the game, your score (number of rounds won) will be displayed.
Requirements
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
A command-line terminal for executing the program
